ABSTRACT:
Most car-hiring systems and radio cab centres come with a middle guy or the agency itself. So what if the corporation like Uber makes a decision to shut down business 
inside the metropolis? If journey-sharing and car lease are moved to the blockchain, without a middleman, each passenger and driver can get linked directly. If the
challenge is finished successfully, it may construct a community that will provide safe, dependable transportation. In this paper, we propose a decentralized car-hiring
service based on Blockchain. However, the majority of present ride-sharing services rely on a third party app or agent which has a centralized network where the 
information of the passengers like address, mobile number etc get stored and so has the possibility of leaking of information. This system already has been implemented
in a few countries, if this was implemented in India both the Cab drivers and the passengers get benefited. So that the data of the passenger is completely secured in
turn the drivers can earn more because of this decentralized network. The proposed gadget allows drivers to offer trip-sharing services without depending on a third
party. Both riders and drivers can know riders' exact trip statistics, such as pick-up/drop-off location, departure/arrival date and journey rate. And those data 
are completely secured and it can only be seen by the drivers end by peer to peer network.
